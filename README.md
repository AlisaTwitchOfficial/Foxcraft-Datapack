Hi, Puff here, in this readme file, you can find 1, instructions on how to download the datapack, 2, a list of the commands to know and what they do relating to the datapack

--------------
Installation :
--------------

    -When creating a new world, click on the tab named "more".
    -Then on the Datapack button.
    -You will be met with a selection screen, click on "open pack folder"
    -Put this datapack in it, close the folder and go back to the game.
    -select the datapack (by swapping it from the left to the right list).
        -You can now create the world and the datapack will work.

    -You might realize upon playing that custom items look the same as vanilla ones, they shouldn't.
    -To fix this, go into your options, into your resource pack selection menu and click "open pack folder"
    -Put a copy of the datapack inside of your resourcepack folder, and select it (by swapping it from the left to the right list)
    -It will say that the version is incompatible, it is normal, ignore that and put it on anyway.
    -you can now go back into your game and see the custom items as well :]
