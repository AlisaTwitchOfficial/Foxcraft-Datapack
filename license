=A.PuffCRlicenseV1=

This license describes how all datapacks, mods and code released by Alisa Puffinetta can (and inversely not) be used.
This license is as the name implied the first version of it and each license released by Alisa Puffinetta sharing that exact nomenclature will be the same.
Each new version of the license will have it's own changes, but will also be treated differently (exemple : A.PuffCRlicenseV1 states A, where as A.PuffCRlicenseV2 could state B, if the license on a work is the first one here, then it A applies etc...).

This version of the A.PuffCRlicense has last been edited on March 12th 2025.
